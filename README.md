This crate provides the `MemorySize` data type as a size unit. This might help errors during conversion between different
units as well as comfort for printing the managed size as a human-readable value.

## Usage
To use this library, you just have to add the following lines into your projects `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.memory-size-type]
version = "0.3.0"
default-features = false
features = ["base10", "base2"]
```

### Examples
There are different use-cases for this library. The following examples represent just some possible usages.

#### Creating an instance from raw byte information
```rust
use memory_size_type::MemorySize;

let size_info_pb = MemorySize::from_pebibytes(13);
let size_info_byte = MemorySize::from_bytes(1024);
```
